#Data
The data for this analysis is from experiments carried out on a group of 30 volunteers. Each person performed six activities while wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II on his or her waist: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying. Using the phone's accelerometer and gyroscope, the experiment captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity data. The initial dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and the rest generated the test data.  The run_analysis.R script subsets and summarizes the data as described in the codebook.  Its ouput is a txt file of the summarized data, which includes the mean values for all mean and standard deviation recordings grouped by experimental subjects and their activities.


#The dataset includes the following files:

* README.txt

* CodeBook.md: Explains all data transformation steps and explains the names of each variable.

* run_analysis.R: The script to reproduce the summary output.
